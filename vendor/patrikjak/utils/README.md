## Installation

Install the package via Composer:

```bash
composer require patrikjak/utils
```

## Setup
After installing the package, add the package provider to the providers array in bootstrap/providers.php.

```php
use Patrikjak\Utils\UtilsServiceProvider;
 
return [
    ...
    UtilsServiceProvider::class,
];
```

Next, publish the package assets:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag="assets" --force
```

## Usage
The Utils package offers a variety of useful classes and functions.

### CSS
To include all component styles, add the main.css file:
    
```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="{{ asset('vendor/pjutils/assets/main.css') }}">
```

You need to set border-box box-sizing for all elements in your CSS file to prevent layout issues:

```css
* {
    box-sizing: border-box;
}
```

### JavaScript
This package does not include a compiled JavaScript file. Instead, import and call functions directly within your main JavaScript file.

Refer to the documentation for a list of available functions and usage examples.

#### Dependencies
Utils requires the following dependencies to function properly:

- [i18n-js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/i18n-js)
- [axios](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios)

```bash
npm install i18n-js axios
```

To load correct language for JS you need to set lang attribute to html tag
    
```bladehtml
<html lang="{{ config('app.locale') }}">
```

Currently supported languages are:
- en
- sk

You will need to set up Vite build target to **esnext** in your `vite.config.js` file:

```javascript
export default defineConfig({
    ...
    build: {
        target: 'esnext',
    },
});
